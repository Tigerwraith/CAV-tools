# CAV:SO Tools
## Acknowledgments
This is a fork of BattleTech Tools created by [Jeffrey D. Gordon](https://github.com/jdgwf). I'm using his work as a basis for the CAV universe. 
## Purpose

The purpose of these tools is to have a centralized, accessible set of tools for CAV unit creation and force building.

## Development

Currently the in development. 

### Technology

This application is a PWA (Progressive Web Application) which allows a user to create Alpha Strike Rosters, Classic BattleTech BattleMechs and eventually more! from any device with access to a modern web browser and should be able to be "pinned" to the home screen of any device including Windows 10 and 11.

The tools are powered by HTML, Bootstrap 4, TypeScript, and React. All data and logic are then compiled and handled by npm.

There are no server moving parts for the application itself, and I'm going to do my best to keep it that way.
